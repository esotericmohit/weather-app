<h1> Here's a description of the steps to resolve API errors on the Weather App: </h1>

<br><br>

<p>1. Visit the official website of OpenWeatherMap at https://openweathermap.org/api.</p>
<br>
<p>2. Create an account by clicking on the "Sign Up" or "Register" option located on the homepage.</p>
<br>
<p>3. Once registered, navigate to your account settings by clicking on your profile icon or username.</p>
<br>
<p>4. In the account settings menu, locate and click on the "My Keys" or "API Keys" section.</p>
<br>
<p>5. Here, you will find a list of API keys associated with your account. If you don't have any keys yet, you may generate a new one.</p>
<br>
<p>6. After obtaining your API key, proceed to the "API" tab or section within your account settings.</p>
<br>
<p>7. Look for the "Current weather API" option and click on it to access the documentation for this specific API.</p>
<br>
<p>8. Within the API documentation, you will find detailed information about how to construct API calls using your API key.</p>
<br>
<p>9. Copy the API call URL provided in the documentation. This URL includes your API key and specifies the endpoint for retrieving current weather data.</p>
<br>
<p>10. Use this copied API call URL in your application code to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.</p>
<br>
<p>By following these steps, you can resolve API errors and ensure smooth integration of weather data into your application.</p>
